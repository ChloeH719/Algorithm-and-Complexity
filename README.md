### **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

**Eigenvectors: These are vectors that, when a linear transformation is applied, change only in scale (not direction). In the context of data analysis, they can represent directions of maximum variance in the data.**

**Eigenvalues: These correspond to the magnitude of the eigenvectors. They indicate the amount of variance captured in the direction of each eigenvector.**

**By analysing the main directions of variance (eigenvectors) and their significance (eigenvalues), ride sharing platforms like Uber can identify patterns or anomalies in ride data. For example, unusual patterns in ride frequency or location data might indicate a need for more drivers in a specific area or at a particular time. Eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis can also aid in understanding the factors that most affect pricing and demand, helping to optimize dynamic pricing models.**
